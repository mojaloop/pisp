# Design Decisions

> For now, let's place the decisions inline for ease of reference, but we may want each decision to have it's own `.md` file in the future.

## Outstanding Questions
- Q: Should the `mojaloop/auth-service` API be Sync or Async?

- Q: How does the switch _know_ to send a callback to the PISP after a sucessful transfer?
  - when DFSPA issues `POST /transfer`, that's between DFSPA  + DFSPB
  - It should have a `transferId` that is related to the `thirdPartyRequest`
    - how does the PISP or Switch know which transaction this `transferId` is related?
    - tx id will be set in the `POST /authorizations` (when the authorization is created by the DFSP)
    - how do we get from a `transactionId` to a `transferId`?
      - ILP packet is in transfer request, but encoded... so need to figure this piece out
    - For now, assume that the `Transaction` object will contain the `transferId`

- Q. How does the switch determine whether or not a DFSP is using their own FIDO service? Do we want to use the ALS or some other method?

- Q. Should the PISP Facing API be a completely separate API, and not a modification to the FSPIOP-API?
  - We would still need to make modifications to the existing API to cater for DFSPs to be able to talk to PISPs, but PISP-facing resources would be contained in the ThirdParty-API (for lack of a better name)
  - This would also imply a new `thirdparty-api-adapter`, to compliment the `ml-api-adapter`
  - The Current Mojaloop API caters to both a bilateral and optional switch mode, and PISP would break this principle
  - The PISP API as part of the existing api would make for a more rigorous and thoroughly designed API, since it has to go though many reviews and approval steps
  


## Decisions Made

### What is the challenge that is being signed during the transfer flow?

The condition from the `QuoteResponse` object should be signed by the PISP app running on the user's device.

### PISP transfer initiation resource

For the PISP role, we will add an additional resource to the API to initiate a 3rd party payment
- currently we are planning on calling it `/thirdPartyRequests/transfer`. This may change.
- For our current implementation work however, we can still use the existing `/transactionRequests` resource.


### Handling of an `/authorization` for external FIDO

In the case where a DFSP wishes to bring their own FIDO Service instead of using the FIDO service that is a part of the hub (`mojaloop/auth-service`), we want to pass on the `PUT /authorization/{id}` (see `AG-26` in the Transfers E2E flow) directly to the DFSP for their own FIDO Service to verify that the public key matches the signed challenge.

This means that we don't need to unpack the `authorization` object, nor do we need to design a new API Endpoint for external auth services.

This does, however, require some thinking about the error cases when verifying the signed challenge. Here is what we have proposed:
- internal (Mojaloop-hosted) fido: failure case for FIDO -> forward error to DFSP in `PUT /authorizations/{id}/error`
- external fido: forward whole `PUT /authorizations/{id}` request to the DFSP to take care
