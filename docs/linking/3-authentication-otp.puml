title PISP Linking: Authentication (OTP)

autonumber 1 "<b>AUTH-#</b>"

== Success case ==

...

note over PISP, DFSP
  Here the user provides the OTP sent directly to them by the DFSP into the PISP App. It's then used as the secret to prove to the DFSP that the user trusts the PISP.
end note

DFSP --> Switch: ""202 Accepted""
deactivate Switch

DFSP -> DFSP: Verify the OTP is correct.\nMove to Grant consent step

note over PISP, DFSP
  At this point, the DFSP believes that the User is their customer and that User trusts the PISP. This means that the DFSP can continue by granting consent.

  Note that the DFSP never "responds" to the Consent Request itself. Instead, it will create a Consent resource in the Grant phase.
end note

== Failure case ==

...

note over PISP, DFSP
  Here the user enters an incorrect OTP.

DFSP -> DFSP: Verify the OTP is incorrect.

note over PISP, DFSP
  We respond with an error that the OTP is incorrect so the PISP can inform the user.
